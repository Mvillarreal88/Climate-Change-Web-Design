## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard

In building this website I create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations.Pages will vary from a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

Total pages will be 7 all including:

* Landing page:
  * An explination of the project and page layout.
  * Visualization links on the right hand.
* Four visualizations pages
  * These will take you to the respective pages with an explination of the plot.
* Comparisons page
  * Contains all visualizations on one page to compare to each other.
  * Clicking on link will also take you to the specific page.
* A Data page
  * Displays tablet with Data used in all visualizations.
